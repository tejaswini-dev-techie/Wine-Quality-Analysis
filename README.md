# Wine-Quality-Analysis

## Problem Statement
1. Predicting wine quality using ML models brings objectivity to subjective evaluations.
2. By analyzing historical data and identifying patterns, these models provide accurate quality assessments, aiding in production, pricing, and selection decisions.
3. Revolutionize the wine industry with data-driven precision and unlock the full potential of your products.

This repository contains the code and resources for a comprehensive Wine Quality Analysis project. The goal is to predict the quality of wines based on various features. The project includes:

1. Data Exploration: Explore and understand the dataset, identifying key features and patterns.

2. Feature Engineering: Perform necessary preprocessing and feature engineering to enhance model performance.

3. Model Training: Train machine learning models to predict wine quality, utilizing algorithms such as Linear Regression, KNN, Random Forest and SVM.

4. Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics and fine-tune to achieve optimal results.

5. Results: Findings, insights, and visualizations related to wine quality predictions.

## Conclusion
SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier yields an accuracy of 0.46, it means that the model's performance is relatively poor. An accuracy of 0.46 indicates that the model correctly predicted the target variable only 46% of the time, which is significantly below what would be expected by random chance.
